# Assignment: Making and Reading from Dictionaries
# Create a dictionary containing some information about yourself or John/Jane Dow.
# The keys should include name, age, country of birth, favorite language.
# 
# Write a function that will print something like the following as it executes:
# 
#   My name is Anna
#   My age is 101
#   My country of birth is The United States
#   My favorite language is Python
# 
# There are two steps to this process, building a dictionary and then gathering all the data from it.
# Write a function that can take in and print out any dictionary keys and values.
# 
# Note: The majority of data we will manipulate as web developers will be hashed in a dictionary using key-value pairs.
# Repeat this assignment a few times to really get the hang of unpacking dictionaries, as it's a very common requirement of any web application.
